# EVENTO-College-Event-Manager

- PROBLEM DESCRIPTION  
Every university, whether big or small, has challenges to overcome in terms 
of managing the information of an event, its related services, registration, 
result declaration, etc. For almost all events that are organized by 
universities, all work is done by hand. The traditional system allows the 
participation of an eligible student and the information about him/her is 
stored manually by using a file system.  
The student community is also at most times unaware of all the details about 
the event because they have not been broadcasted correctly or the reach is 
low.  
The human resources required in the management of all the information of 
the participants’ increases. This system often leads to a communication gap 
between the event managers and the students.

- PROJECT AIM  
The “EVENTO: College Event Manager” application has been developed to 
override the problems prevailing in the practicing manual system. This 
software is supported to eliminate and, in some cases, reduce the hardships 
faced by this existing system. Moreover, this system is designed for the 
particular need of the university event managers to carry out operations 
smoothly and effectively.  
This system aims to help the organization in better utilization of resources. 
Additionally, it provides a user-friendly interface and enables managers to 
access all the information that can be handled only by them making the system 
secure. In this manner, the managers can focus more on other activities than 
record keeping.

- PROJECT DESCRIPTION  
The purpose of the “EVENTO: College Event Manager” System is to 
automate the existing manual system with the help of computerized equipment 
and full-fledged computer software, fulfilling their requirements, so that their 
valuable data/information can be stored for a longer period with easy accessing 
and manipulation of the same. The required software and hardware are easily 
available and easy to work with.  
This application is built to provide an interface where the students can find all 
the information about an event in one place and register themselves for the 
particular event. the admins can access all the information and use it to their 
requirements. the students can also check their results for the various events.
