# EVENTO-College-Event-Manager

- PROBLEM DESCRIPTION  
Every university, whether big or small, has challenges to overcome in terms 
of managing the information of an event, its related services, registration, 
result declaration, etc. For almost all events that are organized by 
universities, all work is done by hand. The traditional system allows the 
participation of an eligible student and the information about him/her is 
stored manually by using a file system.  
The student community is also at most times unaware of all the details about 
the event because they have not been broadcasted correctly or the reach is 
low.  
The human resources required in the management of all the information of 
the participantsâ€™ increases. This system often leads to a communication gap 
between the event managers and the students.
